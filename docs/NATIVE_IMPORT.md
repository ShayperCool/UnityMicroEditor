# Native import

Heavy content (models, audio, compressed textures) is imported by Unity's own AssetImportWorker, driven by this tool's coordinator. The main Editor process, its GUI and a pre-imported `Library` are not needed for a worker run. Scenes and authored prefabs do not go through this path; the runtime loader reads them from source.

Only Unity `6000.6.3f1` on Linux x64 is supported. The coordinator starts `Unity` in AssetImportWorker mode and a separate `Unity.DataStore` from the installed engine. The importers themselves stay inside Unity's executable.

## Commands

Import selected files into a new owned context:

```bash
unity-micro-editor project-import \
  --project /absolute/project \
  --output /absolute/project/Library/UnityMicroEditor/imports/manual-01 \
  --asset Assets/Audio/door.wav \
  --timeout 45s
```

`--asset` can be repeated. `--output` must be a new directory under the project's `Library/UnityMicroEditor` or `Temp`. `--timeout` covers the whole import and is capped at 5 minutes. The coordinator reads the real source and `.meta` bytes and their dependencies, builds its own SourceAssetDB, and extracts the worker's reply from its own DataStore. It checks native content hashes, SHA-256 and that the source inputs did not change. The result is `<output>/result.json`.

This imports the chosen files. It does not bootstrap a project, and it does not create the baseline or catalog that `run` needs.

Accept a successful import into a session's runtime cache without running the worker again:

```bash
unity-micro-editor native-adopt \
  --project /absolute/project \
  --baseline /absolute/.../current.json \
  --output /absolute/project/Library/UnityMicroEditor/Sessions/dev \
  --report /absolute/project/Library/UnityMicroEditor/imports/manual-01/result.json
```

`native-adopt` checks source, metadata and GUID again, along with every copied dependency, the current import environment and the native XXH3-128 and SHA-256 of each artifact. A report without a complete environment record is refused.

Print the current import environment fingerprint without starting any Unity process:

```bash
unity-micro-editor native-environment --project /absolute/project
```

## During a run

Before expanding a scene, the runner walks the GUID references of the selected scene, its runtime prefabs and their authored dependencies. New or changed FBX and WAV files, and PNG files that need native resize or compression, are imported in batches of 32 assets per worker. An unchanged baseline or cache entry is skipped, as is a PNG in the supported raw profile.

Each cache entry records an `environmentSha256`. The fingerprint covers the pinned protocol revision, the Unity path, the exact SHA-256 of `ProjectSettings.asset`, the parsed settings and the wire environment. An index with no fingerprint, or a different one, is skipped and its assets are imported again. Changing this environment while a runner is live requires restarting the runner.

## How an import works

1. The coordinator creates an isolated context with its own `Assets`, `ProjectSettings`, `Packages`, `Library` and `Logs`, and copies the exact source and `.meta` bytes into it.
2. The coordinator writes a minimal `SourceAssetDB` directly: GUIDs, paths, importer settings and XXH3-128 file hashes taken from the sources. Nothing is copied from an Editor.
3. It starts a DataStore with a unique namespace, accepts the worker's local TCP connection, and sends `Initialize`, `Prepare` and `ImportRequest`.
4. Requests use the primary importer ID `-1`, so the native pipeline picks the importer and reads its settings from `.meta`. Explicit importer IDs run an extra importer with default settings and are rejected by content validation.
5. The worker is stopped through the protocol, then the DataStore. It reads only the stopped store, following `ImportResponse.ArtifactBlobs[1]` → `ArtifactMetaInfo.Files[].Hash` → the stored file.

Worker parameters come from an exact copy of `ProjectSettings.asset`: color space, shader precision and the Linux graphics API override. The profile is limited to the Linux standalone target, with OpenGLCore and Vulkan as the verified automatic API set. Unsupported or ambiguous settings are refused. The applied values and the settings hash are written to `environment` in the report.

For each linked file the coordinator checks length, storage bounds and the native XXH3-128 content key, and records SHA-256. Serialized files are inspected with Unity's standalone `binary2text`, which does not start an Editor. Checked files are saved in `<output>/artifacts`, wire payloads in `<output>/frame-*.bin` and process logs in `<output>/logs`.

## Textures

TextureImporter receives the project's default texture compression format and an explicit record that no user overrides exist. DXTC is the verified default.

Cold import is limited to ordinary uncompressed textures. A compressed PNG uses an exact warm artifact from an existing Unity import; a changed source or `.meta` without such an artifact is refused. For BC7, the compressor setting recorded in the artifact database is checked against `EditorSettings.asset`, and its hash is part of the cache key.

## Mesh colliders

An Editor artifact for a mesh with `m_IsReadable=0` can hold vertex and index data but no cooked collision data for a Player. For a MeshCollider, the coordinator writes a separate immutable runtime file with `m_IsReadable`, `m_KeepVertices` and `m_KeepIndices` enabled on the originally unreadable mesh. The FBX, its `.meta`, the scene and the collider geometry are not changed, and the projection is proven byte-identical to the import apart from those three flags.

The loader calls the public `Physics.BakeMesh` with the authored `convex` and `cookingOptions` values, then `UploadMeshData(true)` restores the original unreadable state before user callbacks run. Bounding-box substitutes are not used.

## UI and fonts

Unchanged UXML, USS and font assets are extracted from an existing Unity import cache rather than imported cold. See [UI_IMPORTS.md](UI_IMPORTS.md).

## Limits

- The wire protocol, LMDB schema and DataStore layout were derived for one Unity version and are not a stable public API. A worker version mismatch is refused, and another engine version needs its own verification.
- There is no proven general support for animation, skinned meshes, complex model settings, arbitrary texture settings, other audio codecs, platform overrides, custom AssetPostprocessors or every dependency of an arbitrary project.
- A shader can be imported, but the result has no platform GPU programs and cannot be delivered to a Player without a separate bake.
- The store reader handles inline and concatenated storage, limits one file to 64 MiB and refuses other layouts. The LMDB reader targets the observed Linux x64 format.
- A worker is started per import batch. A persistent native service is not used.

## Code

The coordinator lives in `rust/src/native/`, with the wire format, LMDB reader and SourceAssetDB writer beside it:

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `rust/src/native/import.rs`, `adopt.rs`, `batch.rs`, `importer.rs`, `warm.rs` | Project import, adoption, cold batches and the runtime cache |
| `rust/src/native/probe.rs` | One AssetImportWorker run |
| `rust/src/registry.rs` | The owned SourceAssetDB and native source hashes |
| `rust/src/protocol.rs` | Wire format, requests, responses and `ArtifactMetaInfo` |
| `rust/src/native/datastore.rs` | DataStore namespace, readiness and shutdown |
| `rust/src/lmdb.rs` | Reading a stopped LMDB without a native library |
| `rust/src/native/artifact.rs` | Extracting stored files and checking content keys |
| `rust/src/native/environment.rs` | The import environment fingerprint |

`rust/src/runtimeartifact/` adapts imported serialized files for the Player.

The ordinary tests check protocol and database bounds, corrupted content and wrong settings without starting Unity.
